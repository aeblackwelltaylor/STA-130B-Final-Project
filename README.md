# STA-130B-Final-Project
Healthcare is an ongoing battle in the United States and has been for a while. Some people that healthcare should be affordable if not free and awarded to everyone because it is a human right. While others believe that healthcare should remain privatized and continue to be inaccesible for all groups. Going hand in hand with this is women's reproductive rights. Many believe that abortion should not be legal but don't want to provide expecting mothers with the resources, like affordable healthcare, to keep the baby. Therefore my is exploring how much visit to the doctor cost for Obstetrics doctors. This can range from visits to make sure a pregnancy is healthy to birth contro visits and everything in between. All these costs are from people with Medicare, the insurance offered by the Federal Government.
